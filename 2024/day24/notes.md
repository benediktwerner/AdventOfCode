# Mistake 1

vmv = carry_06 XOR direct_bit_07

vmv <-> z07

# Mistake 2

kfm = direct_bit_20 XOR carry_19

kfm <-> z20

# Mistake 3

hnv = carry_27 XOR direct_bit_28

hnv <-> z28

# Mistake 4

chh = direct_carry_35 AND carry_34
z35 = direct_carry_35 XOR carry_34

direct_carry_35 should be direct_bit_35

direct_carry_35 == tqr
direct_bit_35 == hth

tqr <-> hth

# Answer

```python
>>> ",".join(sorted(["vmv", "z07","kfm", "z20","hnv", "z28","tqr", "hth"]))
'hnv,hth,kfm,tqr,vmv,z07,z20,z28'
```
