# Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) written mostly in Python 3.

There also are some very optimized solutions written in Rust for [2020](2020/optimized) and [2021](2021/optimized).

And I've written some [fun stuff](https://github.com/benediktwerner/intcode) for intcode from 2019, including a compiler from a simple high-level language to intcode.
